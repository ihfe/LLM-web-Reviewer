**Basic reporting
The authors proposed a novel approach for the recognition of isolated sign language videos using Resnet and Support Vector Machines. The paper is interesting but needs major improvements.
First, the abstract does not highlight the actual contribution as SVM and Resnet are well known algorothms. I believe that utlizing these approahces in an effective manner leads to an important contribution, but abstact fails to show the actual working of proposed work.
Second, why authors didnt explored Hourglass network that are specifically designed for post estimation. Some other good allternatives are also missing in discussion such as Densenet.
The title is too confusing, i will suggest do not use abbrevaution and also avoid to lengthen it.
The proposed framewrok is missing leads to a question regarding the major contribution. There is a need of in-depth figure with detail discussion on proposed framework that should highlight the actual contribution.

**Methodology**
1. The paper proposes a system that combines ResNet-18 model training with pose data for spatial feature extraction and MHIs for temporal information.
2. It explores the impact of finger pose-based MHIs and linear interpolation for missing pose data estimation.

**Validity and Reliability of Experiments**
1.The utilization of support vector machine (SVM) for classification enhances the SLR system.

**Questions:
1„ÄÅCould you provide more details about the potential limitations of the proposed methodology?

**Experimental design
Included in basic reporting

**Validity of the findings
Finding seems valid but needs a detailed comparsion with recent studies.

review results: Minor revision
