This paper presents extensions of manifold learning techniques (SNE, LLE, and ISOMAP) for dimensionality reduction and visualization in multi-view data contexts. These multi-view approaches aim to yield more comprehensible sample projections than when visualizing each data-view individually. The authors compare their multi-view methods with existing approaches using both real and synthetic datasets. Among these, multi-SNE demonstrates superior performance.

Strengths:
Overall, the language appears professional and clear, adhering to academic standards.

The article contributes significantly to data visualization by introducing innovative adaptations of well-established manifold learning techniques (multi-SNE, multi-LLE, and multi-ISOMAP) for multi-view data. The methods are elaborated upon with clarity and precision. Furthermore, the real-world applicability of these methods, especially in complex datasets like multi-omics single-cell data, is commendably highlighted, underscoring their practical relevance and utility.

Experimental design
1. Expanding the testing of these methods across diverse datasets would enhance the paper by demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness in varied scenarios. Have the authors explored the application of these methods on additional datasets?

2. Investigating the sensitivity of these methods to hyperparameters and providing detailed guidelines for their selection would greatly benefit the paper. This would ensure the methods' broader applicability and ease of use. Could the authors elaborate on the hyperparameter selection process for each proposed method?

Validity of the findings
1. The potential increase in computational complexity due to the multi-view approaches warrants a detailed discussion of computational demands and potential optimization strategies. How do the proposed multi-view methods (multi-SNE, multi-LLE, and multi-ISOMAP) compare with existing single-view methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?

2. A more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of the proposed methods and the identification of potential avenues for future research would balance the paper and guide forthcoming studies. How could the proposed methods be adapted or extended to accommodate larger datasets or real-time data processing?
