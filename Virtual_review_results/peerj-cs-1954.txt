**Overall Review**

The main point of this paper is to propose a novel approach for isolated sign language recognition (SLR) by integrating pose data and motion history images (MHIs) using the ResNet-18 model.

**Innovation and Contribution**
1. The integration of pose data and MHIs for SLR.
2. The introduction of finger pose-based MHIs (FP-MHI) to capture subtle gesture dynamics.

**Methodology**
1. The paper proposes a system that combines ResNet-18 model training with pose data for spatial feature extraction and MHIs for temporal information.
2. It explores the impact of finger pose-based MHIs and linear interpolation for missing pose data estimation.

**Validity and Reliability of Experiments**
1. The methodology demonstrates competitiveness with existing SLR approaches.
2. The utilization of support vector machine (SVM) for classification enhances the SLR system.

**Adequacy and Appropriateness of Conclusions**
1. The conclusions provide an evaluation of the findings and offer recommendations for the future development of SLR systems.
2. The study contributes to enhancing communication capabilities for individuals with hearing impairments.

**Strengths**
1. Innovative integration of pose data and MHIs for SLR.
2. Comprehensive methodology with competitive results.
3. Clear structure with well-defined sections.

**Weaknesses**
1. Lack of detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed methodology.
2. Limited comparison with existing state-of-the-art SLR systems.
3. Insufficient exploration of the impact of including body and face data in the classification process.

**Questions and Suggestions for Authors**
1. Could you provide more insights into the potential limitations of the proposed methodology?
2. Have you considered conducting further comparisons with other advanced SLR systems?
3. How do you plan to address the impact of including body and face data in the classification process in future research?

**Overall Rating**
I would rate this paper a 7.5. The paper presents a novel approach to SLR with competitive results and clear contributions to the field. However, further exploration and comparisons could enhance the robustness of the study.
