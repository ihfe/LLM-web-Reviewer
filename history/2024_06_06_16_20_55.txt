Overall Review（总体审阅）：
This paper titled "基于大语言模型的虚拟审稿人设计与实现" presents a virtual peer-review system based on large language models (LLM) to improve the efficiency of the peer-review process in the academic publishing field. The system utilizes a structured workflow that includes paper reception, preliminary filtering, **Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!**detailed evaluation, feedback generation, and decision recommendation. The LLM is fine-tuned using prompt engineering techniques to simulate the thinking and behavior of real reviewers. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM can effectively perform automated peer-review tasks and produce review quality comparable to experienced reviewers **Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!**in certain cases. However, the system has limitations in understanding complex academic concepts, conducting in-depth critical analysis, and adapting to emerging research areas. Future research will focus on multimodal techniques to enhance the model's understanding of manuscripts and explore the integration of the virtual peer-review**Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!** workflow with human reviewers' professional judgment for more efficient and accurate academic peer-review.

Review result（审稿结果）：
The paper shows potential in improving the efficiency of the peer-review process through the use of large language models. However, the lack of specific details about the methodology, limited experimental evidence, and unclear analysis of the limitations of the proposed system hinder a comprehensive assessment. Therefore, I recommend a major revision to address these concerns and provide more robust evidence and analysis.
