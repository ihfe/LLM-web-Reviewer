Overall Review（总体审阅）：
This paper titled "基于大语言模型的虚拟审稿人设计与实现" presents a virtual peer review system based on large language models (LLM) to enhance the efficiency of the review process and reduce the reliance on traditional reviewers. The paper introduces the concept of a workflow, which includes steps such**Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!** as paper reception, preliminary filtering, detailed evaluation, feedback generation, and decision recommendations. The LLM is fine-tuned using prompt engineering techniques to simulate the thinking and behavior of real reviewers. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned LLM can effectively perform automated review tasks and produce review**Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!** quality comparable to experienced reviewers in certain cases. However, the virtual peer review system has limitations in understanding complex academic concepts, conducting in-depth critical analysis, and adapting to emerging research areas. Future research should focus on multimodal techniques to improve the model's understanding of manuscripts **Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!**and explore the integration of the virtual peer review workflow with human reviewers' professional judgment to achieve more efficient and accurate academic reviews.
