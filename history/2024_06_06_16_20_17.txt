Overall Review（总体审阅）：
This paper titled "基于大语言模型的虚拟审稿人设计与实现" presents a virtual peer review system based on large language models (LLM) to improve the efficiency of the peer review process. The paper introduces the concept of a workflow, which includes paper reception, preliminary filtering, detailed evaluation, **Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!**feedback generation, and decision-making recommendations. The LLM model is fine-tuned using prompt engineering techniques to simulate the thinking and behavior of real reviewers. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned LLM can effectively perform automated peer review tasks and produce reviews comparable to experienced reviewers in terms**Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!** of quality. However, the virtual peer review system has limitations in understanding complex academic concepts, conducting in-depth critical analysis, and adapting to emerging research fields. Future research will focus on multimodal techniques to enhance the model's understanding of manuscripts and explore the integration of the **Generated by ChatGPT, no copying allowed!**virtual peer review workflow with human reviewers' professional judgment for more efficient and accurate academic peer review.
